## Welcome to the haskell-fun org 👋

🙋‍♀️ This organisation is all about enjoying and evangelising strongly statically typed purel functional programming, using Haskell. We are particularly focused on the pragmatic side of functional programming and see how it can help developers and organisations to be even more lean/agile, to do more with less, to build more robust, safer software in a cheaper way.
