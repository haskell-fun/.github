## Welcome to the haskell-fun org 👋

🙋‍♀️ This organisation is all about enjoying and evangelising strongly statically typed purel functional programming, using Haskell. 
We are particularly interested in the pragmatic side of functional programming, ie, to explore mroe how/when/why it can help developers and organisations to be even more lean/agile, archieve more with less, and build more robust, safer software in a cheaper way
